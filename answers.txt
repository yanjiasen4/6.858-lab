Exercise 2:
[exploit-2a] - [zookd.c:70] - [http.c:105]
overwritten 'reqpath' in function url_decode(). variable 'sql' represents the second part of 'buf' splited by space. We can format a request to 'GET / XXXXXX HTTP/1.0' where 'XXXXXX' represents a string length over 2048. 

[exploit-2b] - [http.c:165]
use 'value' variable overflow 'envvar'. Input must pass the header parse so the format of 'buf' should be 'GET / HTTP1.0\r\n key: valueXXXXXXXX'

Exercise 3(Warm-up):
Change syscall number to 'sys_unlink' and pass '/home/httpd/grades.txt'

Exercise 3:
zookld.c:70 - http.c:105
overflow 'reqpath'

Exercise 4:

use gdb to get 'unlink' address

'p unlink'

set argstring and address of argstring. The overflowed stack can be showed as follow:

| '/home/httpd/grades.txt'    |
|  address of string          |
|  return address (no matter) |
|  unlink address             | <- return address
|  0000000000000000000000000  | <- %ebp
|  0000000000000000000000000  |

Exercise 5:
all in bugs.txt

Exercise 6:
Check length of string and throw error when it get out of bounded.
