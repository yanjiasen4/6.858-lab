#call sprintf() to write 'sp2' into 'envp' which may cause stack overflow.

url_decode() will deocde url of http and write it into 'reqpath'. And 'reqpath' can be overwritten by a long url inputed by user.
    
    url_decode(reqpath, sql);
    
    for (;;)
    {
        ......
        else
        {
            *dst = *src;
            src++;
            if (*dst == '\0')
                break;
        }
        dst++;
    }

#call function http_read_line() which do not check the bound of input.

[http.c:159]
same as bug at 'http.c:105'. variable 'value' can be overwritten by the 'sp' variable because function url_decode do not check the bound of input.

[http.c:165]
'envvar' can be overwritten by the user input 'buf' in function sprintf()

[http.c:282]
'pn' can be overwritten by 'name'.

[http.c:358]
dir_join() will call a strcpy and this may cause 'name' variable overwritten by 'pn'

[zookd.c:70]
